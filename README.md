# CRWN-CLOTHING

This is the result of a direct code-along with Zero-To-Mastery's React Course to follow production of an eCommerce application. As such, this code is not my actual knowledge, but more application of concepts that was shown to me. I'll be keeping this here as a reference point for me for when I'm starting to write my own platform.

## Important note

- Due to this code being part of a lesson, there are various unfinished aspects of this project, including incomplete mobile readiness. This is done purposefully so that if I were to look at this application I can get practise by fixing up these issues that I see fit. However, the code itself should be completely functional.
